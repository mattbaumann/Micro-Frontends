== Context and Problem Statement

We need to store the entity data. It has to be simple to retrieve the data from the file and search after specific datasets.

Also, it is a requirement that each service must have it's own datastore.

== Considered Options

I considered the following datastores
. XML File
. Extern Database
. H2 Database

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: _option 3_. H2 Database is very simple to attach and runs in the same process as the program. Also, simplifies
the data retrieval logic for the application.

=== Negative consequences

. Memory consumption of the Spring process increases
. Performance is nowhere near a production database

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== H2 Database

. {y} Spring Integration
. {y} Simple admin console
. {n} Performance
. {n} Maybe too simple for demonstration purposes

===  XML

. {n} Difficult data search
- {n} Memory unfriendly

=== Extern Database
