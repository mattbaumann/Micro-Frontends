== Context and Problem Statement

We need an exemplary application that works with data in a meaningful manner. This application is then separated into
three projects and composed together again with webFragments.

== Considered Options

I considered the following datastores
. Angular.JS
. React JS
. Lucid JS with JQuery

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: _option 2_. React is fairly simple UI framework. Angular proved to be very complicated and tedious to
program against. Lucid JS with JQuery is not productive enough.

=== Negative consequences

. HTML Tags and React Components are mixed together in markup.
. HTML Tags are written inside Javascript code

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Angular

https://angular.io/[Angular]

. {y} All needed components provided
. {y} Testing already prepared
. {y} Packaging system
. {y} Good separation of concerns
. {n} Performance
. {n} Hard to program (single HTTP GET involves HTTP Library, Reactive Streams, Dependency Injection)

===  React

https://reactjs.org/[React JS]

. {y} Productive programming
. {y} Good UI components
. {n} HTML in JS Files
- {n} Components not separable

=== Lucid JS with JQuery

https://jquery.com/[JQuery]

. {y} Performance
. {y} Understood by the students
. {n} Realistic example
. {n} Hard to setup
. {n} No UI Component library
